harfbuzz 0.9.25 from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ (MIT License)
requires: ucdn

NOTE: mingw32 has a MemoryBarrier() definition that harfbuzz can't work with,
so I changed harfbuzz to ignore it and use its own definition.

NOTE: ragel is needed to compile the .rl files after updating harfbuzz to a new version.
